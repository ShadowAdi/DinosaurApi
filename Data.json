No paratypes have been found, so all estimates ofAbelisaurus' size and anatomy are extrapolations based on other, more complete abelisaurs.The name \"Abelisaurus\" is to honour Professor Roberto Abel, the former director of the Museum of Cipolletti in Argentina; Roberto discovered the holotype ofAbelisaurus comahuensis, which is now stored in the Museum of Cipolletti. \"Comahuensis\" refers to the region in Argentina where the holotype was discovered, Comahue, which spans three provinces: Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro, and the Northern part of Patagonia.",

Oviraptors have been known to nest as many modern birds.Beibeilongwas the first example of a megaoviraptor shown to nest the same way as its smaller relatives.The holotype consists of the partial skeleton of an embryo (referred to as \"Baby Louie\"), which appears to have been removed from its egg before full development, and six to eight eggs. The story of discovery and namingBeibeilongis long, and shows the problems caused by the fossil trade.The specimen was discovered by a farmer named Zhang Fengchen, who excavated it in 1992 or 1993. In mid-1993 the specimen was illegally sold to an American company called The Stone Company, run by Florence and Charlie Magovern from Boulder, Colorado. Charlie was inspecting the eggs, and thought he saw some bones in a chisel gouge. He cleaned away some rock, and confirmed the presence of bones. Three of the paper's authors traveled to The Stone Company to study the specimen. This was when National Geographic photographer Louis Psihoyos came to document the unearthed skeleton. The skeleton was from then on referred to as \"Baby Louie\" in honour of Louis. in 2001, the full skeleton was unearthed, and the entire specimen was acquired by the Indianapolis Children's Museum. The specimen was finally returned to the Henan Geological Museum in China in 2013. In 2015, five of the paper's authors traveled to the excavation site with Zhang Fengchen, and found fossilized eggs identical to those found in the specimen.Beibeilongcomes from Pinyin. \"Beibei\" translates to \"baby\", asBeibeilongwas fossilized as a baby. \"Long\" translates to \"dragon\", as is the common replacement for \"saurus\" in Chinese dinosaurs.Sinensiscomes from Latin, referring to the fact that the dinosaur is from China.",

It was hornless, had a toothed beak, and a frill at the back of its head.Ferrisauruslived in the forests of what is now Northwestern British Columbia, Canada. Leptoceratopsidae is a family of ceratopsians (similar toTriceratops) that are more primitive, so they are smaller, have shorter frills, and no horns.The holotype consists of only a few shoulder and leg bones, and was discovered in 1971 by Kenny Flyborg Larsen, a geologist searching for radioactive materials along a route where a railway was being constructed, as they gave off enough radiation to be detectable. He donated the fossils to Dalhousie University (Nova Scotia, Canada) in 2004, and they were acquired by the Royal British Columbia Museum in 2006. First described in 2008 as an unknown ornithischian, it was re-analyzed and described as a new species in 2019.Ferrisaurustranslates to \"iron lizard\", because the specimen was discovered along a future rail line (possibly because trains used to be referred to as \"iron horses\").

Because of the completeness of the skeleton, it was able to be attributed to the new Halszkaraptorinae family, along with two other already-described Dromaeosaurs (Mahakala omnogovae, Hulsanpes perlei).The holotype is an almost complete skeleton that wasn't flattened during the fossilization process. It is thought to have been poached from an unspecified area of Ukhaa Tolgod, a fossil-rich area of the \u00d6mn\u00f6gov province Mongolia. It was kept in private collections until 2015, when French fossil dealer Fran\u00e7ois Escuilli\u00e9 transferred the specimen to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. It was then returned to the Institute of Paleontology and Geology, Mongolian Academy of Sciences and described in 2017.Halszkaraptoris unique in the fact that it appears to have been at least partially aquatic, as evidenced by its arms being similar to modern swimming birds, serpentine neck, and and toothed beak similar to modern semi-aquatic birds.

Later studies of the holotype also discovered preserved remains of parasites, leading to the earliest known case of parasitic bone disease.Sauropods include the largest dinosaurs discovered, especially Titanosaurs, which makesIbirania parvasurprising because of how small it is. The structure of its bones indicate that it was an adult, making it one of the smallest known sauropods. It is thought thatIbirania parvaevolved its small size due to prolonged droughts in its habitat.Ibiraniacomes from the combination of 'Ibir\u00e1' and 'plania'.

In contention for the largest dinosaur (withArgentinosaurusandDreadnoughtus), it is a quadrupedal sauropod with four thick legs, has a relatively small head, long neck, large body, and a long tail.Patagotitanwould have lived in the Early Cretaceous floodplains of what is now central Chubut Province in Argentina. The Lognkosauria family of titanosaurs contains the largest species of sauropod (and dinosaur) known.The holotype consists of a partial skeleton, without a skull. It was discovered in 2010 by farmer Aureliano Hernandez at La Flecha Ranch in central Chubut Province, and was reported to researchers in 2012. Eight expeditions were carried out from 2012 to 2015 to excavate the holotype and paratypes. The different specimens are preserved in slightly different periods of rock formation, implying that different groups ofPatagotitandied in this area at different times. There are ten paratypes in total:Seven of the paratypes are single leg bones from different individuals. An eighth paratype is a tooth, and a ninth is a vertebra. The tenth paratype is a partial skeleton; the most complete of the paratypes, but less complete than the holotype. The paratypes combined with the holotype can be used to build one of the most complete titanosaur skeletons known.The namePatagotitancomes from the Patagonia region where it was discovered, and the mythological Greek titans, known for their size and power.Mayorumis to honour the Mayo family, who own the La Flecha ranch, and who were very welcoming to the researchers during their multiple expeditions.",

It was described in 2001 as a carnotaur, and re-evaluated in 2007 and classified as an abelisaur.Quilmesaurusgets its name from the Quilme people, a native group of people native to the area that were known for their ferocity and ability to resist Incan and Spanish invaders for 130 years. \"Curriei\" refers to Phillip J.

Generally, ceratopsians (horn-faced dinosaurs) are split into two groups: chamosaurines and centrosaurines. Chasmosaurines had small nose horns, large eye horns, and simple frills with smooth or scalloped edges. Centrosaurines had large nose horns, small eye horns, and elaborate frills with spikes or spades.Regaliceratopsis unique in that it shares the horns and frill spikes of as centrosaur, but is classified as a chasmosaur because of the small frill size and general similarity to chasmosaurs. Since centrosaurs went extinct by the time of this dinosaur, it is thought that it evolved their traits for its own evolutionary needs.The holotype consists of an almost complete skull, which was discovered in 2005 by Canadian geologist Peter Hews while on a fishing trip along the Oldman River in Southern Alberta. The skull was encased in very hard rock on a cliff face about a metre (3 feet) above the waterline. During excavation, no debris was allowed to fall into the river, as it is the habitat of Alberta's provincial fish (the bull trout). Because of these factors, excavation took years, and the description was only completed in 2015. Because of these terrible excavation conditions, the specimen was nicknamed 'Hellboy'.Regaliceratopscomes from the Greek \"regalis\" meaning \"royal\", and Latin \"ceratops\" meaning \"horned face\".Peterhewsirefers to Peter Hews, the geologist who discovered the specimen.",
